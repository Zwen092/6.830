# Disclaimer
This repository contains my implementation of `SimpleDB` from MIT 6.830(Intro to Database Systems), which focus on the **Storage** part
rather than the **Server** part of a RDBMS. 

All source code lies in `src/java/simpleDB`

I made this repo public only intended for the examine of future employer and serve as a reference for other people who are struggling in this project. Otherwise,
it should be private in accordance with the course policy.
